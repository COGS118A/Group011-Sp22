    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",

    "Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for all people from all racial and ethnic groups in the United States. According to the data from CDC, “one person dies every 36 seconds in the United States from cardiovascular disease<a name=\"CDC\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#CDC) and about 659,000 people in the United States die from heart disease each year<a name=\"CDC\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#CDC), which is 1 in every 4 deaths<a name=\"CDC\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#CDC)”. Besides, heart disease placed huge fiscal stress on the Federal government, “costing about 363 billion dollars each year from 2016 to 2017\"<a name=\"CDC\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#CDC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many prior works have been done in this area. One prior work done by Davide Chicco & Giuseppe Jurman<a name=\"BMC\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#BMC) analyzed a dataset of 299 patients with heart failure and performed an alternative feature ranking analysis using traditional biostatistics tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another work done by Rohit Bharti, Aditya Khamparia and et al.<a name=\"Hindawi\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#Hindawi) tried to predict Heart Disease using a combination of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. They used a Public Health Dataset containing 76 attributes and employed various methods including KNN, PCA and SVM to do the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using ML algorithms to do the Heart Disease Prediction can be really important because good prediction can help lower the risk of the disease and further prevent life threat. Even an inaccurate prediction can indirectly provide us with some meaningful data that shows relationship between the factors that contribute most to heart disease. Therefore, answering the question such as which factors contribute most to heart disease can be really necessary.\n"

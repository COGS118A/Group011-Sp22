    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "# Abstract \n",
    "Nowadays, heart disease can be regarded as one of the most fatal diseases in the world. And nearly 647,000 Americans die from heart disease every year. Thus, developing an ML model to detect and predict heart disease may help the patients get effective treatment at the early stage, significantly reducing the probability of causing death. To build the model, we decide to use a dataset that measures the possible indicators that cause heart disease like high blood pressure, alcohol, or smoking. By evaluating these indicators, we may be able to predict whether an individual has heart disease. CDC collects the data in the dataset through telephone surveys, including the health status of US adults in over 50 states. And before building the ML model, we will firstly preprocess the data, converting them into appropriate data types and abandoning some features if needed. After the model is created, we will use some metrics or criteria to evaluate its accuracy, determining whether it is a successful model.\n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for all people from all racial and ethnic groups in the United States. According to the data from CDC, “one person dies every 36 seconds in the United States from cardiovascular disease<a name=\"CDC\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#CDC) and about 659,000 people in the United States die from heart disease each year<a name=\"CDC\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#CDC), which is 1 in every 4 deaths<a name=\"CDC\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#CDC)”. Besides, heart disease placed huge fiscal stress on the Federal government, “costing about 363 billion dollars each year from 2016 to 2017\"<a name=\"CDC\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#CDC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many prior works have been done in this area. One prior work done by Davide Chicco & Giuseppe Jurman<a name=\"BMC\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#BMC) analyzed a dataset of 299 patients with heart failure and performed an alternative feature ranking analysis using traditional biostatistics tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another work done by Rohit Bharti, Aditya Khamparia and et al.<a name=\"Hindawi\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#Hindawi) tried to predict Heart Disease using a combination of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. They used a Public Health Dataset containing 76 attributes and employed various methods including KNN, PCA and SVM to do the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using ML algorithms to do the Heart Disease Prediction can be really important because good prediction can help lower the risk of the disease and further prevent life threat. Even an inaccurate prediction can indirectly provide us with some meaningful data that shows relationship between the factors that contribute most to heart disease. Therefore, answering the question such as which factors contribute most to heart disease can be really necessary.\n"

To be specific, age can be regarded as an essential factor influencing the probability of having heart disease, and we use numeric values to represent it. Second, smoking history can be seen as another critical indicator of heart disease. Most patients with heart diseases have a long smoking history. In this dataset, we use Boolean values to represent this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moreover, BMI also plays an essential role in affecting the likelihood of getting heart disease. Many studies have shown the close relationship between them. And we use numeric values (float) to represent it in this dataset.\n",

    "- For the variables (features) that are Boolean or String, we need to convert them into categorical variables using one-hot encoding. For the numeric variables, we may apply some normalization to them, which will help improve the accuracy of our machine learning model. Also, we may need to abandon some features. Precisely, we can calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient for the variables and decide whether to leave it.\n",
